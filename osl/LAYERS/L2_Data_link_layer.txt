ðŸ”— "Reliable transfer of frames over a physical medium"

What It Does.
The Data Link Layer is responsible for node-to-node deliveryâ€”ensuring that 
data transferred between two directly connected devices is error-free and
well-structured.

It takes raw bits from "the Physical Layer and organizes them into frames".

                                            HANDLES 
"MAC addressing", 
"error detection", and 
"flow control".

MAC (Media Access Control)
Assigns and recognizes MAC addresses.
Controls access to the physical transmission medium.

                                            ADVANCED CONCEPTS
ðŸ”¹ MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)
                                        A 48-bit unique hardware address assigned to every NIC.
                                        Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
                                        Used to identify devices on the same network segment.

ðŸ”¹ Frame Structure
                    A typical Ethernet frame includes:
                    [ Preamble | Dest MAC | Src MAC | Type | Payload | CRC ]

ðŸ”¹ Error Detection: CRC
                        CRC adds a checksum to detect data corruption.
                        If mismatch happens, the frame is discarded.

ðŸ”¹ CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)
                      Ethernet uses this to avoid multiple devices transmitting at the same time.
                      If collision detected â†’ Back off, wait, try again.

ðŸ”¹ Switches operate at Layer 2
                        They forward frames using MAC addresses.
                        Build a MAC address table to make frame forwarding decisions.

                                          ðŸ’» REAL-TIME EXAMPLE
ðŸ“± WhatsApp on Wi-Fi (continued from Layer 1)

Your mobile wants to send voice packets over your Wi-Fi router.

It wraps each packet in a frame with:
Your phoneâ€™s MAC as source,
Routerâ€™s MAC as destination.
The router gets the frame, reads the MAC address, checks for errors, and 
forwards the data to the next device.

                TOOLS/DEVICES:
                Switches: Forward frames using MAC.
                NIC (Network Interface Card): Adds/removes MAC addresses.
                Wireshark: Tool to analyze Layer 2 frames.

                ARP:
                ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Maps IP â†” MAC (though it belongs to Layer 3, 
                it supports Layer 2)

Troubleshooting Examples
| Symptom                                       | Possible Layer 2 Issue        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Devices canâ€™t ping each other on the same LAN | Wrong or duplicate MACs       |
| Slow LAN communication                        | Switch flooding or loops      |
| Packet loss in Wi-Fi                          | Frame collision, interference |

âœ… This layer ensures the data reaches the next hop on the path without corruption 
and with the correct MAC address.
