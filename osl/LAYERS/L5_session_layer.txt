üß≠ "Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications."

                      üß† What is a Session?
A session is like a dialog box or a meeting between two applications.
                It begins when a connection is established.
                It continues while both sides exchange data.
                It ends when one side closes the session or it times out.







The Session Layer makes sure this "conversation" is:
                Initiated properly,
                Maintained (even if interrupted),
                Terminated cleanly.








                    üéØ Responsibilities of the Session Layer
| Function              | Description                                                               |
| Session Establishment | Begins a dialog between apps (like logging into a server)                 |
| Session Maintenance   | Keeps the communication alive, even across disruptions                    |
| Session Termination   | Ends the session gracefully                                               |
| Synchronization       | Adds checkpoints or markers in a long transmission (for recovery)     |
| Dialog Control        | Controls who speaks when in two-way communications (half/full duplex) |








                  Real-Time Example

Example 1: Remote Login via SSH
- You log in to a remote server.
- SSH (Application Layer) establishes a session.
- The Session Layer tracks:
          The state of your login
          Whether you‚Äôre authenticated
          If the session times out or disconnects

Example 2: Video Conferencing (Zoom, Skype)
The session layer maintains the voice and video session:
          Detects if one party disconnects
          Keeps the call state
          Restores the session if interrupted (in some apps)








            ‚ö° Dialog Control: Half vs Full Duplex

| Mode        | Meaning                             | Example       |
| Half Duplex | One side speaks at a time           | Walkie-talkie |
| Full Duplex | Both sides can speak simultaneously | Phone call    |
The Session Layer may manage and switch these modes based on network or app behavior.







               üß± Protocols & APIs Used at This Layer
There are no famous standalone protocols purely at Layer 5, 
but it's embedded in many high-level frameworks and APIs:
| Protocol / API                  | Use                                 |
| RPC (Remote Procedure Call) | Session-based remote function calls |
| NetBIOS Session Service     | Windows LAN communication           |
| Sockets API (via TCP)       | Session tracking via program logic  |
| RTP/RTCP (used in VoIP)     | Session timing and control          |








                üõ† Why It Matters
Web session ‚Üí Maintains your login state on a website
Banking ‚Üí Ends session after inactivity (secure session timeout)
Video call ‚Üí Maintains state if network drops briefly
File transfer ‚Üí Allows resume from last checkpoint instead of restarting

                  Real-Life Analogy
Think of the Session Layer like a meeting room coordinator:
                Books the room (establish session)
                Ensures both sides are present and speaking in turns
                Reschedules or resumes if interrupted
                Ends the meeting cleanly

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Session Creation    | Starts a dialogue between two systems                 |
| Session Maintenance | Maintains continuity and monitors connectivity        |
| Recovery            | Can use checkpoints to resume after interruptions |
| Control             | Manages who sends/receives and when                   |



‚úÖ In Reality:
The Session Layer is not a standalone layer implemented by the OS like TCP/IP.
Instead, session management is handled by:

üî∂ 1. The Application Itself
Most modern applications manage their own sessions.

Example	Who manages the session?
Web app (like Amazon, Gmail)	The web server and browser (via cookies, tokens)
SSH Client	SSH protocol session logic
Database Client (e.g., MySQL Workbench)	DB client and server maintain session state
Video call (e.g., Zoom)	Application‚Äôs internal session manager

üìå Programmers or developers write code that:

Initiates sessions (e.g., login)
Tracks session state (e.g., user activity, authentication)
Ends sessions after logout or timeout

üî∂ 2. The Application Frameworks / Middleware
          Frameworks often include built-in session layer logic, such as:
          HTTP frameworks (like Express.js, Django, Spring Boot):
          Use cookies, headers, or session IDs
          Remote Procedure Call frameworks (like gRPC, Thrift):
          Handle session channels
          Socket libraries (like WebSocket, ZeroMQ):
          Maintain bi-directional communication sessions

üî∂ 3. Underlying Protocols with Session-Like Features
          Although TCP itself is a Transport Layer protocol, it assists with session-like behavior:
          Connection establishment (3-way handshake)
          Maintains the link until closed
          Used as a foundation for application-layer sessions


‚û°Ô∏è Session is created by the SSH protocol, 
    handled at Application + Transport Layer together.
