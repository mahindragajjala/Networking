üåê "Responsible for delivering packets across multiple networks 
    ‚Äî from source to destination IP address."


                        üß† WAHT IT DOES ?
The Network Layer is in charge of:

- End-to-end delivery of packets between devices on different networks 
  (even across the globe).

- Uses IP addresses, routing, and subnetting to figure out the best path.

- Unlike Layer 2, which only works within the local network, 
  Layer 3 routes data across networks.

                      KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
| Feature                | Description                                                            |
| Logical addressing     | Assigns IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) to devices.            |
| Routing                | Finds the best path from sender to receiver across different networks. |
| Packet forwarding      | Delivers packets from hop to hop through routers.                      |
| Fragmentation          | Breaks large packets into smaller ones if needed.                      |
| Error handling and TTL | Uses TTL (Time To Live) to prevent infinite loops.                 |


                     IMPORTANT CONCEPTS
1. IP Addressing
                Every device gets a unique IP address.
                Example: 192.168.0.10 (IPv4), 2001:db8::1 (IPv6)
                It helps to identify the sender and receiver globally.

2. Routing
          Routers forward packets based on destination IP.
          They use routing tables to decide:
          Which path or next hop to take.
          Whether to go inside local network or toward internet.

3. Subnetting
            Divides a big network into smaller logical networks.
            Helps organize devices and manage traffic efficiently.
            Example:
            Network: 192.168.1.0/24
            Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.127
            Subnet 2: 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.255

4. TTL (Time To Live)
                    A number that decreases on every hop (router).
                    Prevents packets from circulating forever.

5. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
                    Used for network diagnostics (e.g., ping, traceroute).
                    Works under IP.

                   DEVICES AT NETWORK LAYER
| Device         | Role                                           |
| Router         | Connects different networks and routes packets |
| Layer 3 Switch | Performs switching based on IP                 |
| Firewall       | Filters traffic based on IP, ports, etc.       |


                  REAL TIME EXAMPLE - NETWORK LAYER
Let‚Äôs say you're visiting www.google.com on your browser.

Your device sends a packet with:
                              Source IP: 192.168.0.2
                              Destination IP: 142.250.195.68 (Google‚Äôs IP)
Your router sees that the destination is outside the local network.
                It forwards the packet to your ISP.
                The ISP‚Äôs routers pass it along the best path (using BGP/OSPF/etc.).
                Eventually, it reaches Google‚Äôs data center.
                Google responds, and the packet follows the reverse route back to you.

üí¨ This delivery is managed by the Network Layer ‚Äî not by MAC, but by IP address.

| Problem                      | Tool                   | Reason                      |
| Can‚Äôt reach external website | `ping`, `traceroute`   | Bad route, IP block         |
| IP conflict                  | `ipconfig`, `ifconfig` | Two devices with same IP    |
| Dropped packets              | TTL expired            | Routing loops or misconfigs |
