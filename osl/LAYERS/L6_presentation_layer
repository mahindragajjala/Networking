🎭 "The translator and stylist of the OSI model — ensures 
     that data is in a usable and secure format."

                      🧠 Purpose of the Presentation Layer
This layer is all about data representation — it makes sure that:
    Sender’s data format is understood by the receiver.
    Data is encrypted/decrypted securely.
    Data is compressed/decompressed efficiently.
    Think of it as the translator, compressor, and encrypter of the network stack.

Key functions :
| Feature                         | Description                                                                                |
| Data Translation                | Converts between different formats (e.g., ASCII ↔ EBCDIC, XML ↔ JSON)                      |
| Encryption / Decryption         | Secures data using algorithms (e.g., TLS, SSL, AES)                                        |
| Compression / Decompression     | Reduces data size for faster transmission (e.g., ZIP, GZIP)                                |
| Serialization / Deserialization | Converts complex data (e.g., structs, objects) to/from byte streams (e.g., JSON, Protobuf) |


                            🔐 Encryption in Presentation Layer
🔒 When you send:
You type your credit card info on a website → It is encrypted using TLS.
Hacker sees only: 3aR9d$@f%@3# (gibberish).

🔓 When received:
The server decrypts it → gets your actual credit card number.

🔐 TLS (Transport Layer Security) works between the Application and Transport layers, 
    but conceptually belongs to the Presentation Layer.


🗜️ Compression
Why send 100 KB when you can send 30 KB?
| Protocols      | Compression Types               |
| HTTP/2, HTTP/3 | Uses `gzip`, `brotli`           |
| VoIP / Video   | Uses codecs like Opus, H.264    |
| File Transfer  | `.zip`, `.tar.gz` at this layer |




🔁 Data Formatting / Serialization
                    Format	Use Case
                    JSON	Web APIs (human-readable)
                    XML	SOAP APIs, configs
                    Protobuf / gRPC	High-performance APIs
                    ASN.1	Telecom, SNMP
                    YAML	Configuration

Your app might generate a complex object like:

{
  "user": {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Mahindra"
  }
}
The Presentation Layer logic ensures it's properly converted to a byte stream and 
then reversed at the receiver.

                  L3 - Network           ← IP, Routing
                  L2 - Data Link         ← MAC, Frame control
                  L1 - Physical          ← Cables, WiFi, voltage
