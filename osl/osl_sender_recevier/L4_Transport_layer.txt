The Transport Layer ensures endtoend communication between two systems. It handles:

Reliable delivery
Error recovery
Segmentation and reassembly
Flow and congestion control



SENDER SIDE â€“ Transport Layer Responsibilities
 Function / Operation       Description                                                                                     
    
 1. Segmentation        Breaks large data from the Application Layer into smaller chunks called "segments".       
 2. Port Addressing     Adds source and destination port numbers to identify applications (e.g., port 80 for HTTP). 
 3. Sequence Numbering  Numbers each segment to allow reordering and reassembly at the receiver.                
 4. Reliability (TCP)   Ensures segments arrive without errors, in order, and only once.                    
 5. Flow Control        Manages how much data can be sent before needing acknowledgment.                                
 6. Protocol Used       Uses TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast, unreliable).                                          

ðŸ“¥ RECEIVER SIDE â€“ Transport Layer Responsibilities
Function / Operation	              Description
1. Reassembly	                      Reorders the received segments using "sequence numbers".
2. Error Checking	Verifies          checksums to "detect corruption".
3. Acknowledgments (TCP)	          Sends ACK (or retransmit request) for each segment received.
4. Deliver to Correct Application	  Uses the destination port number to deliver the data to the right program (e.g., web browser, video player).




Real-World Protocols in Transport Layer
Protocol	Description
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)	Reliable, ordered, connection-oriented. 
                                    Used by HTTP, HTTPS, FTP.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)	Unreliable, connectionless, faster. 
                                    Used by DNS, VoIP, video streaming.


          ðŸ“¦ Real-Life Example (Transport Layer in Action)
                You open www.flipkart.com in your browser:

The browser sends an HTTP request.
The Transport Layer on your computer:
                  Segments the request,
                  Adds TCP headers with sequence numbers and port 
                  (e.g., port 80),
                  Sends to the Network Layer.

The Transport Layer on Flipkartâ€™s server:
                  Reassembles segments,
                  Acknowledges received data,
                  Passes complete request to the web server software
