The Application Layer is the interface between the "user" and "the network". 

It provides services and protocols that allow users and applications to access 
the "network" and "communicate" over it.

üìå It doesn‚Äôt mean the actual software application (like Chrome or Skype), 
but the network services that support those applications (like HTTP, DNS, FTP).
