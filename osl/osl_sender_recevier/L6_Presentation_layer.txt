The Presentation Layer is responsible for the 
                      translation, 
                      encryption, 
                      compression, and 
                      formatting of data. 
It ensures that data sent by the application layer of one system can be 
understood by the application layer of another.

Think of it as the "translator" and "formatter" between applications on different 
systems.

              üì§ SENDER SIDE ‚Äì Presentation Layer Responsibilities
Function / Operation	           Description
1. Data Translation	             Converts data from application format to network format (e.g., text to binary).
2. Encryption	                   Applies encryption for secure transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS).
3. Compression	                 Compresses data to reduce size and optimize transmission.
4. Serialization	               Prepares structured data (like JSON/XML) for transmission.

            üì• RECEIVER SIDE ‚Äì Presentation Layer Responsibilities
Function / Operation	            Description
1. Decryption	                    Converts encrypted data back into readable form.
2. Decompression	                Restores the original size of the compressed data.
3. Data Translation	              Converts data into a format the application can understand.
4. Deserialization	              Converts data back into usable structures (objects, files, etc.).

            üåê RealWorld Examples of Presentation Layer
 Example              What the Presentation Layer Does                    
 HTTPS (SSL/TLS)  Encrypts data before sending it over the internet. 
 JPEG, MP3, MPEG  Compresses multimedia files for faster transfer.   
 JSON, XML        Formats structured data for APIs and config files. 
 ASCII ‚Üî Unicode  Converts between character encoding schemes.       


üß† Analogy
          Imagine two people speaking different languages using an interpreter:
          The interpreter translates (like text encoding),
          Uses code words (encryption),
          And may shorten phrases (compression).
          That‚Äôs what the Presentation Layer does for computers.
