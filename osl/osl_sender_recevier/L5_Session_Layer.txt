                                    üéØ Primary Role:
The Session Layer manages and controls dialogues (sessions) between two computers. 
It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between 
applications.


                    üì§ SENDER SIDE ‚Äì Session Layer Responsibilities
Function / Operation	           Description
1. Session Establishment	       Initiates a session between local and remote applications.
2. Authentication	               Can verify the identity of the sender and receiver (e.g., login session).
3. Authorization	               Checks if a user has permission to access certain resources or services.
4. Session Management	           Ensures only one session per task and tracks session activity.
5. Dialog Control	               Manages who sends/receives and when (fullduplex/halfduplex).

                  
                  üì• RECEIVER SIDE ‚Äì Session Layer Responsibilities
Function / Operation	      Description
1. Session Acceptance	      Accepts the session request from the sender.
2. Resynchronization	      Restores a session if it was interrupted (by crash, timeout, etc.).
3. Checkpointing	          Allows recovery by marking points to resume transmission if broken.
4. Session Termination	    Ends the session when communication is complete.



                  üåê RealWorld Examples of Session Layer
Example Scenario	                  Session Layer Role
Login to a website	                Starts a secure session for your interaction.
Video conferencing (Zoom, Teams)	  Manages active session between participants.
Remote desktop	                    Maintains session state for desktop control.
Streaming media	                    Keeps a session active with the server (buffering checkpoints).
Online banking	                    Ends session after inactivity for security.

üîê Session Layer Protocols
Protocol	                                Description
RPC (Remote Procedure Call)      	        Allows execution of code on a remote system.
NetBIOS	                                  Establishes and manages sessions in Windows networks.
PPTP (PointtoPoint Tunneling Protocol)	Used in VPNs for session tunneling.
SOCKS	                                    Proxybased session control.
