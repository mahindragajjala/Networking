| Function / Operation           | Description                                                                                             |
| 1. Bit Encoding                | Converts digital data (0s and 1s) from the Data Link Layer into electrical, optical, or radio signals.  |
| 2. Signal Transmission         | Sends these signals (voltage, light pulses, or RF waves) over the physical medium.                      |
| 3. Modulation (if needed)      | For analog mediums (e.g., telephone lines or wireless), digital bits are modulated into analog signals. |
| 4. Line Configuration          | Determines point-to-point or multipoint connection setup.                                               |
| 5. Transmission Mode           | Defines Simplex, Half-Duplex, or Full-Duplex data flow.                                     |
| 6. Medium Selection            | Selects the transmission medium: Copper cable, Fiber optics, Air (wireless), etc.                       |
| 7. Clock Synchronization       | Ensures timing coordination to transmit bits at the correct rate.                                       |
| 8. Physical Topology Awareness | Adjusts transmission based on network topology: Star, Bus, Ring, etc.                                   |


RECEIVER SIDE ‚Äì Physical Layer Responsibilities
| Function / Operation                    | Description                                                                                                       |
| 1. Signal Reception                     | Captures the physical signals from the transmission medium.                                                       |
| 2. Bit Decoding                         | Converts the received electrical, light, or radio signals back into binary data (0s and 1s).                      |
| 3. Demodulation (if needed)             | If analog transmission was used, it demodulates the analog signal to retrieve digital data.                       |
| 4. Synchronization Detection            | Matches timing to ensure bits are interpreted correctly (clock recovery).                                         |
| 5. Error Detection (Basic)              | Detects physical noise or signal errors (bit-level errors), though deeper error handling is done in upper layers. |
| 6. Signal Amplification or Regeneration | If the signal is weak (in analog systems), it may be amplified; in digital, repeated or regenerated.              |
| 7. Medium Interface                     | Interfaces with the correct port (e.g., Ethernet port, wireless antenna).                                         |
| 8. Forwarding Bits                      | Passes the received bits upward to the Data Link Layer for further processing.                                    |

The Physical Layer doesn‚Äôt understand the concept of ‚Äúto whom‚Äù in terms of 
addresses or identities (like IPs or MACs). Instead, it just sends raw bits 
over a physical medium to the next device it's connected to, without knowing 
who is on the other side.

üì§ On Sender Side:
The Physical Layer receives encoded bits from the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) 
and transmits them as electrical, optical, or radio signals over the 
transmission medium.

üëâ It sends to ‚Üí the physical interface of the next device on the 
    link (wire, fiber, or air).

üì• On Receiver Side:
The Physical Layer receives the raw signals from the medium, converts them 
to bits, and passes those bits upward to the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
