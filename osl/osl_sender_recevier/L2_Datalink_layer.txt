It ensures reliable data transfer between two directly connected devices over 
the physical layer. 

It packages raw bits into frames, handles MAC addressing, 
and detects/corrects errors that may occur during transmission.



SENDER SIDE â€“ Data Link Layer Responsibilities

 Function / Operation      Description                                                                                         
 1. Framing            Takes packets from the Network Layer and encapsulates them into frames (adds headers/trailers). 
 2. MAC Addressing     Adds source and destination MAC addresses to help identify the devices on a LAN.                
 3. Error Detection    Adds errorchecking code like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) to detect transmission errors.          
 4. Flow Control       Prevents fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver (in some protocols).                         
 5. Access Control     Decides who gets to send on a shared medium (important in Ethernet/WiFi).                      
 6. Protocol Handling  Uses protocols like Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, or WiFi (802.11).     

RECEIVER SIDE â€“ Data Link Layer Responsibilities
 Function / Operation                   Description                                                                       
    
 1. Frame Reception                 Accepts the signal from the physical layer and interprets it as a data frame. 
 2. MAC Address Filtering           Checks if the destination MAC address matches the device's address.           
 3. Error Checking                  Uses CRC or checksum to detect errors in the received frame.                  
 4. Frame Synchronization           Ensures the start and end of the frame are correctly recognized.                  
 5. Acknowledgments (if supported)  Some DLL protocols send ACK/NACK for error recovery.                              
 6. Passes Data Up                  Sends the frame payload (packet) to the Network Layer (Layer 3).          

EXAMPLES OF THE DATA LINK LAYER
 Technology                         DLL Role                                                        
 Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)          Adds MAC addresses and frames the packet for LAN communication. 
 WiFi (IEEE 802.11)            Handles frame delivery over wireless and resolves collisions.   
 PPP (PointtoPoint Protocol)  Used in dialup and VPNs to frame and manage direct links.      
 Switch                         A Layer 2 device that uses MAC addresses to forward frames. 



ðŸŽ¯ Example
You open "www.amazon.com" on your laptop via Wi-Fi:
The Data Link Layer on your laptop:
Takes the IP packet from Layer 3,
Adds source and destination MAC addresses (e.g., your laptop and your router),
Adds CRC bits for error detection,
Sends the frame down to the Physical Layer, which sends it as RF signals over air.

At the router:
DLL checks CRC and destination MAC.
Accepts it if MAC matches.
Passes it up to Layer 3 (Network Layer) for routing to Amazon.


âœ… Switch â†’ Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Feature	Explanation
Role - A switch forwards frames between devices within the same LAN using MAC addresses.
Layer - 	Layer 2 â€“ Data Link Layer
Address Used - MAC address
Function -	Builds a MAC address table and sends frames only to the intended device (unlike hubs, which broadcast).
Example -	Your laptop sends data to a printer over Ethernet. 
          The switch checks the destination MAC and forwards the frame only to the printer port.

âœ… Router â†’ Network Layer (Layer 3)
Feature	Explanation
Role - A router connects multiple networks and decides the best path to send packets based on IP addresses.
Layer - Layer 3 â€“ Network Layer
Address Used - IP address
Function - Uses routing tables, protocols (like OSPF, BGP), and forwards packets to their next hop.
Example	 - When you access www.google.com, your router forwards the request 
            from your home network to the internet based on IP routing.







PHYSICAL LAYER AND DATA LINK LAYER COMMUNICATION (SENDER SIDE AND RECEIVER SIDE...)
                       Sender Side: Communication Flow
                          Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Takes the network layer packet and creates a frame.
Add s MAC header (source and destination MAC addresses).
Adds CRC (error checking).
Passes the frame to the Physical Layer.

                         Physical Layer (Layer 1)
Converts the frame (binary data) into electrical/optical/radio signals.
Sends the raw bits (01010101...) over the medium (cable/wireless).
Doesnâ€™t understand structure; only cares about signals and bits.

                    Receiver Side: Communication Flow
                      Physical Layer (Layer 1)
Receives the electrical/optical/radio signals.
Converts signals back into bit stream (0s and 1s).
Passes raw bits to the Data Link Layer.

                    Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Receives the bitstream and reconstructs the frame.
Checks for errors (CRC check).
Reads the destination MAC address.
If it matches the device, removes the Data Link header and passes the payload (network packet) to Layer 3 (Network Layer).



Communication Between Data Link and Physical

What it sends	-> Frames (structured, includes headers) ->	Bits (raw 1s and 0s as signals)
What it expects	-> Bit-level transmission and reliability -> 	No framing knowledge, just transmission
Interface between them	-> NIC (Network Interface Card)	-> Converts frames to signals and vice versa
