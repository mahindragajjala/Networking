üìå Primary Role:
                The Network Layer is responsible for:
                Routing data between different networks.
                Assigning logical addresses (IP addresses).
                Determining the best path for data to reach its destination.

 Function / Operation       Description                                                                                      
 1. Logical Addressing  Adds the source and destination IP addresses to each packet.                                 
 2. Packetizing         Encapsulates the segment from the Transport Layer into a packet.                             
 3. Routing Decision    Determines the next hop/router the packet should go through.                                 
 4. Fragmentation       Breaks large packets into smaller pieces to match the network's MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit). 
 5. Routing Protocols   Uses protocols like OSPF, RIP, BGP to discover network paths.                                

üì• RECEIVER SIDE ‚Äì Network Layer Responsibilities
 Function / Operation            Description                                                  
 1. Packet Reception         Receives the packet from the Data Link Layer.               
 2. IP Address Check         Checks whether the destination IP address matches the host. 
 3. Packet Reassembly        Reassembles fragments (if any) into the full packet.        
 4. Pass to Transport Layer  Sends the payload (segment) to the Transport Layer.         




üåê Real Example (Network Layer in Action)
You type www.amazon.com in a browser:
Your system queries DNS and gets an IP for Amazon.
The Network Layer adds:
Source IP: Your device's IP (e.g., 192.168.0.10)
Destination IP: Amazon's server IP (e.g., 205.251.242.103)
A router reads the IP header, checks its routing table, and forwards the 
packet toward Amazon‚Äôs data center.





You send a WhatsApp message on your phone (WiFi):

Network Layer:
IP Header: Source IP = your phone, Destination IP = WhatsApp server.
Data Link Layer (WiFi):
MAC Header: Source MAC = your phone‚Äôs WiFi card, Destination MAC = WiFi router.

At the router:
L2 MAC addresses are changed (because it‚Äôs a new local network).
L3 IP headers remain the same (endtoend delivery).


" Routers operate at the OSI Layer 3: the Network Layer."

                          ‚úÖ What Routers Do at Layer 3:
Inspect IP Header of incoming packets.
Determine Next Hop using the routing table.
Forward the Packet to the next router or final destination.
Update the Layer 2 Info:
                          MAC addresses (L2) are updated for each hop.
                          IP addresses (L3) stay the same (endtoend).




                      üì¶ Example: When a packet moves across routers
Imagine this flow:
                      Your PC ‚Üí Router1 ‚Üí Router2 ‚Üí Server
                      The IP packet stays the same at every hop (L3 unchanged).
                      The Ethernet frame (L2) is recreated at each hop with:
                      New source MAC = current router
                      New destination MAC = next hop/router

                                  ROUTER VS SWITCH
üìå Switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
üìå Routers operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer)

But:
üîÑ Switches and routers often work together, and data flow can go either 
way depending on the context and network topology.


Common Scenario: Who Sends to Whom?
 Context                                                  Flow                 Reason                                                                                       
      
 User sends packet to a remote IP (e.g., google.com)  Switch ‚Üí Router  Switch delivers the frame to the router because the destination IP is outside local network. 
 Router sends a packet to a device in local LAN       Router ‚Üí Switch  Router sends the packet to the switch to reach the correct MAC/device in local network.      
 PC1 communicates with PC2 (same LAN)                 Switch only      Router not involved. Switch forwards directly using MAC addresses.                           


EXAMPLES OF THE BOTH ROUTER VS SWITCH
üéØ Case: You are accessing google.com from a PC at home

Your PC creates an IP packet with:
                        Source IP = your PC
                        Destination IP = google.com (public IP)
Since this IP is outside your local network, your PC:
                        Uses default gateway = your router
Builds an Ethernet frame with:
                        Destination MAC = your router's MAC
                        Source MAC = your PC‚Äôs MAC
This frame is sent to the switch:
                        The switch looks at the destination MAC (router's MAC)
                        It forwards the frame to the router port.

‚úÖ So in this case:
PC ‚Üí Switch ‚Üí Router
Now when the router sends data back to you:
Router gets a response from Google and wants to send it back to your PC:
                Builds a frame with your PC's MAC as destination
                Forwards the frame
Router connects to the switch:
                Sends frame ‚Üí Switch forwards to your PC.

‚úÖ In this case:
Router ‚Üí Switch ‚Üí PC
