IP addressing and ports


                        What is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected 
to a network that uses the Internet Protocol to communicate.



                          Types of IP Addresses
 Type            Description                              Example                 
 IPv4        32-bit numeric address (4 octets)        `192.168.0.1`           
 IPv6        128-bit alphanumeric address             `2001:0db8::1`          
 Public IP   Used over the internet; unique globally  `103.21.244.1`          
 Private IP  Used inside local/private networks       `192.168.x.x`           
 Static IP   Manually assigned; doesn't change        Server IPs              
 Dynamic IP  Assigned via DHCP; can change            Home WiFi devices       
 Loopback    Refers to the device itself              `127.0.0.1` (localhost) 
 APIPA       Auto-assigned if DHCP fails              `169.254.x.x`           



1. ✅ What is a Port?
                  A port is a logical endpoint for communication. 
                  It allows multiple services to run on a single IP 
                  address by identifying different applications.
                  IP Address + Port Number = Socket
                  Range: 0 - 65535




                              Port Number Ranges
           Range          Type              Examples                          
           0 - 1023       Well-known Ports  HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22)  
           1024 - 49151   Registered Ports  MySQL (3306), Postgres (5432)     
           49152 - 65535  Dynamic/Private   Temporary client-side connections 




                  Common Protocols and Ports
