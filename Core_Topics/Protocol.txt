                                Definition
A protocol in computer networking is a set of "rules" and "conventions" that determine
how data is transmitted and received across a network. 

Think of it like a "language" both sender and receiver must agree on to understand 
each other.


                          üîÅ Example Analogy: 
Just like people need a common language (e.g., English or Hindi) to communicate, 
computers use protocols to ensure their data exchanges are understood on both 
sides.

                      üîç Why Are Protocols Important?

üõÇ Ensure reliable communication between devices.
üì¶ Define how data is formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.
üîÑ Allow interoperability among different hardware and software systems.
üîê Define security rules, error handling, compression, etc.

                      üß± Structure of Protocols in Networking
Protocols are categorized based on their function across different layers of 
the OSI or TCP/IP model.

              Flow Control (e.g., TCP sliding window)
              Congestion Control (e.g., TCP congestion avoidance)
              Session Management
              Error Detection and Correction (e.g., CRC at Data Link layer)

                      üß© Interrelation of Protocols
Protocols don‚Äôt work in isolation. 
They form stacks (like TCP/IP stack), where each layer‚Äôs protocol adds its 
own header or function, and the whole packet is transmitted through layers.

          üìç Where Rules and Conventions Exist in Networking Protocols?

 Protocol Layer   Example Protocol  üîß Rules                                                üß≠ Conventions                                                                          
 Application  HTTP              GET, POST, headers must follow specific syntax              Server listens on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) by convention                               
 Transport    TCP               3-way handshake, acknowledgments, retransmissions required  Ephemeral client ports (e.g., 49152‚Äì65535) by convention                                    
 Network      IP                IP packet must have source and destination IP addresses     Private IP ranges (like `192.168.x.x`) are conventionally not routed on the internet        
 Data Link    Ethernet          MAC addresses are 48 bits, frames must include a CRC        MAC address is burned into NIC, but can be overridden (common convention in virtualization) 
 Security     TLS               Handshake rules, cipher negotiation, cert verification      Using port 443 for HTTPS is convention
