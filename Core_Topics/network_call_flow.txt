Step 1: User types https://www.google.com in browser
        Component: Application (Browser)
        Protocol: HTTP/HTTPS (Layer 7)
        → Requests DNS resolution
Step 2: DNS Query to resolve www.google.com
        Component: OS Resolver → Router → DNS Server
        Protocol: DNS (Layer 7, UDP/TCP on port 53)
        NIC sends the request with:
                        MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01
                        Private IP: 192.168.1.10
                        Destination IP: e.g., 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
Step 3: Packet goes to Switch
        Switch Role: Forwards Ethernet frames using MAC table (Layer 2)
        → Forwards to Router
Step 4: Router forwards using IP
        Identifies destination is outside local network
        Performs NAT
 Step 5: NAT (Network Address Translation)
        Replaces Private IP 192.168.1.10 with Public IP 203.0.113.5
        Adds mapping in NAT table for response routing
Step 6: Request travels to DNS server
        DNS responds with 142.250.190.132 for google.com
Step 7: Browser creates HTTPS Request to 142.250.190.132
        TCP 3-Way Handshake (Layer 4)
        TLS Handshake (Layer 6/7)
        HTTP GET Request (Layer 7)
Step 8: Google Server responds → Router → Switch → NIC → Browser

 Component        Role/Function                                      OSI Layer                               
 End User     Application initiator (e.g., browser)              Layer 7                                 
 NIC          Hardware to transmit bits, uses MAC address        Layer 1 (Physical), Layer 2 (Data Link) 
 MAC Address  Hardware address for device identification in LAN  Layer 2                                 
 Private IP   IP assigned within LAN (e.g., 192.168.x.x)         Layer 3                                 
 Public IP    IP on the Internet (e.g., 203.0.x.x)               Layer 3

 Router       Routes packets across networks using IP            Layer 3                                 
 NAT          Translates private ↔ public IP                     Layer 3 (extra function of router)      
 DNS          Resolves domain names to IP addresses              Layer 7                                 
 Protocols    E.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, ARP              Layers 2–7
