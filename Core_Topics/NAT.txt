                            NAT (Network Address Translation)


          NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method used in computer networks to map 
          private IP addresses to a public IP address (or addresses) before transferring 
          the information to another network—typically the internet.

- It plays a crucial role in IPv4 networks where IP addresses are limited. 
- NAT enables multiple devices in a private network to access the internet 
  using a single public IP address.



Why NAT is Needed
IPv4 Address Exhaustion: There are only about 4.3 billion IPv4 
                          addresses.

Security: NAT hides internal network structure from outside world.

Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for each internal device 
                to have its own public IP.


Types of NAT
 Type                                Description                                                                                              
 Static NAT                      Maps one private IP to one public IP (1:1 mapping).                                                      
 Dynamic NAT                     Maps a private IP to any available public IP from a pool (not always same).                              
 PAT (Port Address Translation)  Also called NAT Overload, maps many private IPs to one public IP using different ports. Most common. 



How NAT Works
            Let’s say you have a device in your home network with the 
            private IP: 192.168.0.10, and it wants to access 
            https://example.com.

Without NAT:
            Private IP 192.168.0.10 tries to talk directly to the 
            internet—won’t work, because private IPs are non-routable 
            over the internet.

With NAT (PAT):
        Router replaces source IP (192.168.0.10) with its 
        public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.5) and adds a unique source port.
        
        When a reply comes back, the router uses the port to 
        translate back to the correct internal IP and port.
