              NIC stands for Network Interface Card. 

It is a hardware component‚Äîeither built into the motherboard or 
added as an external card‚Äîthat allows a computer or other device 
to connect to a network.



                        Purpose of a NIC
The NIC is the interface between your computer and the physical 
network medium (like Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi signals). 

It converts data from the CPU (digital form) into signals that 
can travel over the network.

                      Real-Time Example
Imagine a desktop PC connected to the internet via a LAN cable:
- The LAN cable is plugged into the NIC.
- The NIC translates data from the computer into signals on the cable.
- Similarly, incoming signals from the cable are converted by the 
  NIC into data your CPU can understand.

                              Types of NIC 
 Type                    Description                                                   
 Ethernet NIC        For wired LAN connections using RJ-45 connectors.             
 Wi-Fi NIC           For wireless connections (built into laptops or USB dongles). 
 Fiber NIC           Uses optical cables for very high-speed connections.          
 Virtual NIC (vNIC)  Software-based NIC used in virtual machines (VMs).            


                        NIC Components
MAC Address
A unique hardware ID burned into the NIC (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

Controller Chip
Processes data and manages the flow of packets.

Transceiver
Converts digital data to network signals and vice versa.

Buffer Memory
Temporary storage for incoming/outgoing packets.
