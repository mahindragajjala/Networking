                         DNS (Domain Name System) in computer networking.

                  DNS (Domain Name System) is like the Internet's "phonebook".

- It translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses 
  (like 142.250.183.132) that computers use to identify each other on the network.
- Without DNS, you’d have to remember IP addresses to access websites.



Why is DNS Needed?
              Humans remember names, not IP addresses. DNS solves:
                        - Name-to-IP resolution
                        - Easier scalability of web services
                        - Load balancing (via round-robin DNS)
                        - Email delivery (via MX records)


How Does DNS Work?
      1. You type: www.example.com
      2. Your computer checks its "local DNS cache".
      3. If not found, it asks the "configured DNS resolver" (usually your ISP).
      4. Resolver contacts a "Root DNS Server" → Asks for ".com"
      5. Root server replies: "Ask the TLD DNS server for .com"
      6. Resolver contacts the ".com TLD server" → Asks for "example.com"
      7. TLD replies: "Ask the Authoritative DNS server"
      8. Resolver contacts the Authoritative DNS server → Gets IP for "www.example.com"
      9. IP is returned to your browser → Browser connects to the IP


Call flow:
          Browser → Local Cache
                 → ISP Resolver
                   → Root DNS (.)
                     → TLD Server (.com)
                       → Authoritative Server (example.com)
                         → Returns IP (93.184.216.34)
          Browser → Connects to IP



 Key Components in DNS
         Component                 Description                                              
         Resolver              Your system or ISP's DNS client that starts the query    
         Recursive Resolver    Goes through multiple steps to get the IP                
         Root DNS Server       Top-level server that knows about TLDs                   
         TLD DNS Server        Servers that manage `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.         
         Authoritative Server  Final authority that holds actual records for the domain 



DNS Record Types
                   Record Type  Purpose                             
                   A        Maps hostname to IPv4               
                   AAAA     Maps hostname to IPv6               
                   CNAME    Alias of another domain             
                   MX       Mail exchange server info           
                   NS       Nameserver for the domain           
                   TXT      Text record (SPF, DKIM, etc.)       
                   SOA      Start of Authority; domain settings 
                   PTR      Reverse lookup (IP to domain)       

         Record  Maps/Does What?        Example Use                         
         A       Domain → IPv4          `example.com → 192.0.2.1`           
         AAAA    Domain → IPv6          `example.com → ::1`                 
         CNAME   Domain → Domain        `blog → medium.com`                 
         MX      Mail Server routing    `gmail.com handles mail for domain` 
         NS      Points to DNS server   `Cloudflare or GoDaddy`             
         TXT     Meta info like SPF     `Email security, ownership`         
         SOA     Zone authority info    `Primary DNS, refresh rate`         
         PTR     IP → Domain (reverse)  `93.184.216.34 → example.com`       


You visit: www.google.com
                      Browser → checks local DNS cache
                      Not found → asks 8.8.8.8 (Google’s public DNS resolver)
                      8.8.8.8 asks root server
                      Gets pointer to .com TLD server
                      Gets pointer to google.com's authoritative server
                      Gets A record → 142.250.183.132
                      Your browser connects to that IP

Types of DNS Servers
               Type                      Description                            
               Caching DNS Resolver  Stores DNS results temporarily         
               Authoritative DNS     Contains real data for domains

               Root / TLD Servers    Special purpose hierarchical servers   


DNS Security Features
                  DNSSEC – Prevents DNS spoofing by signing responses
                  DoH (DNS over HTTPS) – Encrypts DNS queries
                  DoT (DNS over TLS) – Also encrypts DNS queries over TLS
