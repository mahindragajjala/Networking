What is NAS in 5G?
NAS (Non-Access Stratum) is a control plane protocol in 5G used for communication between the UE (User Equipment) 
and the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function).

Main Use: It carries 
                    mobility management, 
                    session management, 
                    authentication, and 
                    security-related signaling between UE and 5G Core (AMF).

Where does NAS operate?
                      Between:
                              📱 UE ⟷ AMF
                      
                      Transmitted via:
                                      🚪 gNB (RAN) using the NGAP protocol (on N2 interface)
                      
                      Transport path:
                                    UE (NAS message) → gNB (encapsulates in NGAP) → AMF

                        * NAS is independent of the access network (RAN).
                        * It’s carried as payload inside NGAP messages.


  Main Functions / Use Cases of NAS:
                                     NAS Function                     Description                                                  
                                     🔐 Authentication            Helps establish mutual trust between UE and network          
                                     🔐 Security Mode Control     Negotiates and activates encryption and integrity protection 
                                     🪪 UE Registration (Attach)  UE registers with 5GC using NAS messages                     
                                     🔄 Mobility Management       Handles tracking area updates, idle ↔ connected transitions  
                                     🌐 PDU Session Management    Establishes and manages data sessions with SMF               
                                     📴 Deregistration (Detach)   Allows UE to gracefully disconnect from the network          
                                     📑 Configuration Updates     Updates UE with changes in AMF or network settings           


  Examples of NAS Messages:
                           Message Type                         Purpose                           
                           `RegistrationRequest`                Sent by UE to begin registration  
                           `AuthenticationRequest/Response`     Authentication process            
                           `SecurityModeCommand/Complete`       Activate ciphering/integrity      
                           `RegistrationAccept/Complete`        Confirms successful registration  
                           `PDU Session Establishment Request`  UE requests internet/data session 
                           `PDU Session Release Request`        UE ends data session              
                           `DeregistrationRequest`              Disconnects from network

NAS is responsible for setting up security keys used by both RAN (AS layer) and Core (NAS layer).
Two layers of security:
                      AS Security: Between UE ↔ gNB
                      NAS Security: Between UE ↔ AMF
Ensures:
        Message confidentiality (encryption)
        Integrity (tamper detection)
