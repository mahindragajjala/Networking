Control Plane Protocol Stack
Used for signaling and management between UE ↔ gNB ↔ AMF (in 5GC)


UE ↔ gNB ↔ AMF (over N1 and N2)
 Layer          Function                                                                  
 NAS        Non-Access Stratum: UE ↔ AMF messages (e.g., registration, session setup) 
 NGAP       NG Application Protocol: gNB ↔ AMF communication                          
 SCTP       Transport for NGAP messages

Notes:
      NAS is not terminated at gNB; it passes transparently to AMF.
      NGAP is between gNB and AMF only, not seen by UE.
