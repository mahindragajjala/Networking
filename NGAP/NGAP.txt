NGAP (NG Application Protocol) is a control plane protocol used in the 5G system between the gNB (next-generation NodeB) and the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) over the N2 interface.

It handles control signaling — meaning it does not deal with user data, but manages connections, sessions, handovers, and mobility.


Where is NGAP Used?
                    Interface: N2
                    Between: gNB (Radio Access Network) ↔️ AMF (Core Network)

Protocol Stack:
                Application Layer: NGAP  
                Transport Layer: SCTP  
                Network Layer: IP  
                Data Link & Physical: Ethernet/Optical (etc.)

 Main Functions / Use-Cases of NGAP:
 Function                            Description                                                          
 UE Registration                 Helps establish connection when a UE wants to register with the 5G network 
 UE Context Management           Create, update, and release UE context information at AMF                  
 PDU Session Management          Initiates or releases data sessions via the SMF                            
 Paging                          AMF can page the UE via NGAP if it is in idle mode                         
 Handover Control                Handles intra-5G or inter-RAT handovers                                    
 NAS Transport                   Carries NAS messages from UE to AMF and vice versa                         
 UE Mobility Event Notification  Notifies AMF of UE mobility-related events                                 
 Error Indication & Reporting    Reports errors, unexpected states, and failures                            


UE Registration Flow (Simplified)
                                UE → gNB → AMF (via NGAP: InitialUEMessage)
                                AMF → gNB (via NGAP: InitialContextSetupRequest)
                                gNB → UE (includes NAS message)

UE Handover Flow
                gNB → AMF (HandoverRequired)
                AMF → target gNB (HandoverRequest)
                Target gNB → AMF (HandoverRequestAcknowledge)
                AMF → source gNB (HandoverCommand)

PDU Session Establishment
                          UE → gNB → AMF (InitialUEMessage with NAS PDU)
                          AMF → SMF (via N11)
                          SMF → AMF (session setup response)
                          AMF → gNB (NGAP: InitialContextSetupRequest)
