Networking allows multiple computing devices to connect, 
communicate, and 
share resources with each other. 

The main purpose is to enable 
efficient, 
secure, and 
scalable 
data exchange between systems—whether in the same room or across the globe.


1. Resource Sharing

Goal: Share hardware (like printers, scanners) and software (applications, files).

Example: Multiple employees in an office print documents using a single shared network printer.

2. Data Communication

Goal: Enable systems or users to send and receive data over a medium.

Example: Sending an email from your laptop to a colleague’s computer, or accessing cloud storage.

3. Centralized Data and Management

Goal: Store data centrally so it’s accessible from multiple devices and can be managed easily.

Example: A server holds the company database, and employees access it via their networked computers.


4. Remote Access

Goal: Allow users to access files, applications, and systems remotely.

Example: Accessing office files from home using VPN or cloud services like Google Drive.

5. Scalability

Goal: Easily add or remove devices and users without major changes.

Example: A company can plug in a new employee’s laptop to the network and grant access quickly.

6. Communication and Collaboration

Goal: Improve collaboration through email, chat, video calls, and shared tools.

Example: Tools like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Zoom enable real-time collaboration across the globe.

7. Data Backup and Security

Goal: Centralized backups and consistent security policies for all connected devices.

Example: Automatic backups to a central server and centralized antivirus/firewall configuration.

8. Cost Efficiency

Goal: Reduce hardware and software cost by sharing and centralizing.

Example: No need for each employee to have individual printers or software licenses—central systems can be shared.

9. Performance and Load Distribution

Goal: Distribute workloads across multiple machines to optimize performance.

Example: A web server cluster handling incoming requests using load balancing.
