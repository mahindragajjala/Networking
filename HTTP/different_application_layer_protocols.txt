 ðŸ§  KEY POINTS:

* Application layer protocols define how applications talk over 
  the network.
* They depend on lower layers (especially Transport Layer: TCP/UDP).
* Many of them have both secure (HTTPS, FTPS, SFTP) and insecure 
  versions (HTTP, FTP, Telnet).
* Some are stateless (HTTP), others are stateful (FTP, SMTP 
  sessions).
