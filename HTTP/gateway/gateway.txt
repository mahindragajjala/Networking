A gateway is similar to a proxy but it often translates between
different protocols, acting as a bridge between different 
systems.
ðŸ§  Use cases:
              API Gateway (e.g., convert HTTP to gRPC)
              Protocol translation (HTTP â†” SOAP, HTTP â†” MQTT)
              Microservices control entry point

Example (API Gateway):
                Client â†’ API Gateway â†’ Service 1 (REST)
                                          â†˜ Service 2 (gRPC)
                                          â†˜ Service 3 (SOAP)
REAL-TIME EXAMPLES:
 Tool/Service      Type           Description                                             
 Nginx         Reverse Proxy  Load balancing, caching, SSL termination                
 Squid Proxy   Forward Proxy  Web filtering, caching, access control                  
 Envoy / Kong  API Gateway    Protocol translation, traffic control for microservices 
 Cloudflare    Reverse Proxy  CDN, DDoS protection, caching                           
 VPN Services  Forward Proxy  Hide IP and encrypt outbound traffic
