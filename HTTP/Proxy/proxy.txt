A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client 
and another server 
and forwards the clientâ€™s requests to that server.

There are two main types:

ğŸ‘‰ A. Forward Proxy (Client-side Proxy)
ğŸ“Œ What it does:
              Sits in front of the client.
              Hides the client's identity from the server.
              Controls or filters outgoing requests.

ğŸ§  Use cases:
              Access control in organizations
              Content filtering (e.g., block social media)
              Caching frequently accessed content
              Bypassing geo-restrictions (VPNs)

+--------+      +----------------+      +-------------+
| Client | ---> | Forward Proxy  | ---> | Web Server  |
+--------+      +----------------+      +-------------+
         (Client is hidden from the server)

         
ğŸ‘‰ B. Reverse Proxy (Server-side Proxy)
ğŸ“Œ What it does:
          Sits in front of the server.
          Hides the serverâ€™s details from clients.
          Distributes load, adds caching, SSL termination, etc.

ğŸ§  Use cases:
Load balancing (e.g., Nginx or HAProxy)
Centralized SSL termination
Caching, rate limiting
Security & hiding internal infrastructure
