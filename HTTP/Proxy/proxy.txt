A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client 
and another server 
and forwards the client‚Äôs requests to that server.

There are two main types:

                            üëâ A. Forward Proxy (Client-side Proxy)
üìå What it does:
              Sits in front of the client.
              Hides the client's identity from the server.
              Controls or filters outgoing requests.

üß† Use cases:
              Access control in organizations
              Content filtering (e.g., block social media)
              Caching frequently accessed content
              Bypassing geo-restrictions (VPNs)


Client ‚Üí Forward Proxy ‚Üí Internet (Server)
+--------+      +----------------+      +-------------+
 Client  --->  Forward Proxy   --->  Web Server  
+--------+      +----------------+      +-------------+
         (Client is hidden from the server)


 Use Case                                   Explanation           
 üåê Internet Access Control             In organizations, forward proxies can restrict or allow access to websites (e.g., block Facebook, allow only company tools). 
 üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Anonymity                Hides the client's real IP address by sending requests using the proxy's IP.                                                 
 üîç Logging & Monitoring                Useful for auditing and monitoring employee internet usage.                                                                  
 üßπ Content Filtering                   Blocks malware, ads, adult content, or phishing sites before they reach the client.                                          
 üö´ Bypass Geo-restrictions             Access websites that are blocked in your region by routing traffic through another country.                                  
 üì• Caching Content                     Caches frequently requested data (e.g., images, websites) to reduce bandwidth and improve speed.                             
 üß™ Traffic Inspection or Modification  In security environments, forward proxies can inspect or alter HTTP headers for security testing.                            

         
                              üëâ B. Reverse Proxy (Server-side Proxy)
üìå What it does:
          Sits in front of the server.
          Hides the server‚Äôs details from clients.
          Distributes load, adds caching, SSL termination, etc.

üß† Use cases:
Load balancing (e.g., Nginx or HAProxy)
Centralized SSL termination
Caching, rate limiting
Security & hiding internal infrastructure

Client ‚Üí Reverse Proxy ‚Üí Internal Server(s)
+--------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
 Client  --->  Reverse Proxy   --->  Backend Server 
+--------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
         (Server is hidden from the client)

 Use Case                           Explanation                                                                                     
 üõ°Ô∏è Security (Hide Backend)    Hides internal servers‚Äô IPs and structure from the outside world. Clients only see the proxy.   
 ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancing              Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.            
 ‚öôÔ∏è SSL Termination             Handles SSL/TLS encryption at the proxy, so backend servers don't need to manage encryption.    
 üßπ Caching                     Serves cached content to reduce backend load and improve response time.                         
 üîç Compression / Optimization  Can compress responses (e.g., gzip) or optimize payloads before sending to clients.             
 üìã Monitoring / Logging        Central point to log all incoming traffic before reaching internal services.                    
 üîÄ Routing                     Routes requests to different servers based on path, hostname, etc. (e.g., `/api` vs `/static`). 

                                üîπ Transparent Proxy
                  Invisible to users; used for monitoring or filtering.


Main uses of the proxy ?

 Function                  What It Does                                    
 Privacy & Anonymity   Hides client IP from the server (forward proxy)                          
 Access Control        Blocks specific sites or services                                        
 Caching               Speeds up response time for frequent requests                            
 Security              Filters malicious traffic, enforces authentication                       
 Load Balancing        Distributes requests across backend servers (reverse proxy)              
 SSL Termination       Decrypts SSL at proxy level, passes plain HTTP to backend                
 Protocol Translation  Converts HTTP ‚Üî HTTPS, or REST ‚Üî gRPC (used in reverse proxies/gateways)
