A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client 
and another server 
and forwards the clientâ€™s requests to that server.

There are two main types:

                            ðŸ‘‰ A. Forward Proxy (Client-side Proxy)
ðŸ“Œ What it does:
              Sits in front of the client.
              Hides the client's identity from the server.
              Controls or filters outgoing requests.

ðŸ§  Use cases:
              Access control in organizations
              Content filtering (e.g., block social media)
              Caching frequently accessed content
              Bypassing geo-restrictions (VPNs)


Client â†’ Forward Proxy â†’ Internet (Server)
+--------+      +----------------+      +-------------+
 Client  --->  Forward Proxy   --->  Web Server  
+--------+      +----------------+      +-------------+
         (Client is hidden from the server)

         
                              ðŸ‘‰ B. Reverse Proxy (Server-side Proxy)
ðŸ“Œ What it does:
          Sits in front of the server.
          Hides the serverâ€™s details from clients.
          Distributes load, adds caching, SSL termination, etc.

ðŸ§  Use cases:
Load balancing (e.g., Nginx or HAProxy)
Centralized SSL termination
Caching, rate limiting
Security & hiding internal infrastructure

Client â†’ Reverse Proxy â†’ Internal Server(s)

 Client  --->  Reverse Proxy   --->  Backend Server

         (Server is hidden from the client)


                                ðŸ”¹ Transparent Proxy
                  Invisible to users; used for monitoring or filtering.


Main uses of the proxy ?

 Function                  What It Does                                    
 Privacy & Anonymity   Hides client IP from the server (forward proxy)                          
 Access Control        Blocks specific sites or services                                        
 Caching               Speeds up response time for frequent requests                            
 Security              Filters malicious traffic, enforces authentication                       
 Load Balancing        Distributes requests across backend servers (reverse proxy)              
 SSL Termination       Decrypts SSL at proxy level, passes plain HTTP to backend                
 Protocol Translation  Converts HTTP â†” HTTPS, or REST â†” gRPC (used in reverse proxies/gateways)
