 🔹 1. Definition

* A proxy is an intermediate server that sits between a client and a destination server.
* It forwards client requests to other servers and can modify, block, or log them.



 🔹 2. Types of Proxies

 ➤ Forward Proxy

* Placed between client and internet.
* Hides client identity from the server.
* Example: Used in corporate networks to control and monitor employee internet access.

 ➤ Reverse Proxy

* Placed between internet and server.
* Hides server details from the client.
* Example: Used by web services to load balance or provide security (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy).



 🔹 3. Key Operations / Functions

 Function             Forward Proxy              Reverse Proxy               
 Security         Blocks outgoing traffic    Filters incoming traffic    
 Caching          Speeds up client requests  Speeds up server responses  
 Anonymity        Hides client IP            Hides server IP             
 Access Control   Restrict client usage      Restrict public access      
 Load Balancing   ❌                          ✅ (Distributes traffic)     
 SSL Termination  ❌ (rare)                   ✅ (offloads TLS decryption) 



 🔹 4. RealWorld Examples

 Use Case                   Proxy Type     Example Tool               
 School restricts YouTube   Forward Proxy  Squid                
 Cloudflare CDN             Reverse Proxy  Cloudflare           
 Load balancing servers     Reverse Proxy  NGINX, HAProxy       
 VPN service (private web)  Forward Proxy  Shadowsocks, Privoxy 



 🔹 5. How They Work (Simple Flow)

 ✅ Forward Proxy:


[Client] → [Forward Proxy] → [Internet Server]


> Client sends request → Proxy checks → Forwards to server → Returns result to client

 ✅ Reverse Proxy:


[Client] → [Reverse Proxy] → [Backend Server]


> Client requests → Proxy receives it → Routes to correct internal server → Sends back response



 🔹 6. Common Use in Golang

* Use http.ReverseProxy from net/http/httputil for reverse proxy
* Use middleware to create simple forward proxies (e.g., logging or modifying outgoing requests)



 🔹 7. Benefits

* Security (masking origin)
* Performance (caching, compression)
* Scalability (load balancing)
* Monitoring & Logging



 🔹 8. Risks

* Misconfigured proxies can lead to data leaks.
* Maninthemiddle attacks if used insecurely.
* Can block legitimate traffic if not filtered correctly.
