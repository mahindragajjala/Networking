The HTTP request & response lifecycle describes the journey of an HTTP message from 
a client (like a browser) to a server, and back again, usually over TCP/IP. 

Understanding this is crucial for developers, especially when building 
web apps, APIs, or debugging performance issues.



🔁 HTTP Request & Response Lifecycle: Step-by-Step
> 🔍 Example: You open your browser and type https://www.amazon.in



 1. 🧠 User Action & URL Parsing

 💡 What Happens

 You type or click https://www.amazon.in in your browser.
 Browser parses the URL into components:
   Scheme: https
   Host: www.amazon.in
   Port: 443 (default for HTTPS)
   Path: / (homepage)



 2. 🌐 DNS Resolution

 💡 What Happens
 Browser checks if it already knows the IP address via:
   Browser cache
   OS DNS cache
   Router cache
 If not found: sends a DNS query to resolve www.amazon.in → 13.234.210.38 (example)



 3. 🔗 TCP Connection Establishment

 💡 What Happens

 Browser opens a TCP connection to the resolved IP at port 443
 Performs 3way handshake:

Client         Server
  | -- SYN -->   |
  | <-- SYN-ACK  |
  | -- ACK -->   |





 4. 🔐 TLS Handshake (Only for HTTPS)

 💡 What Happens

 Since HTTPS is used:

   TLS handshake is done to establish a secure connection
   Server sends certificate (SSL cert)
   They negotiate a shared symmetric encryption key

✅ Now the connection is secure



 5. 📤 HTTP Request Sent
 💡 What Happens
 Browser sends an HTTP GET request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.amazon.in
UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64)
Accept: text/html
AcceptEncoding: gzip
Connection: keepalive
Cookie: session_id=XYZ123




 6. 🧠 Web Server Processing

💡 What Happens
Web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or AWS load balancer) receives the request.
It routes to the backend service (Node.js, Go, Java etc.)
The backend may:
              Authenticate user using session/cookies
              Fetch data from a database
              Communicate with microservices
              Render a dynamic HTML page or JSON API



 7. 📥 HTTP Response Sent Back

 💡 What Happens

The server responds with:
                          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                          ContentType: text/html
                          ContentLength: 56832
                          CacheControl: maxage=600
                          SetCookie: session_id=XYZ123; Secure; HttpOnly


Body: (HTML content of the homepage)



 8. 🌍 Browser Renders the Page

 💡 What Happens

 Browser receives the response
 Parses HTML
 Downloads additional resources (CSS, JS, Images) via more HTTP requests
 Builds the DOM and renders the page



 9. 🔁 Persistent Connection / Reuse

 HTTP/1.1 uses persistent connections (Connection: keepalive) so browser reuses the 
TCP connection for multiple requests (CSS, JS, images).
 In HTTP/2, multiple requests are multiplexed over a single TCP connection.



 10. 📦 Caching (If Applicable)

If the response has caching headers like:
CacheControl: maxage=600
The browser or CDN stores the response for 600 seconds to avoid fetching again.
