🔄 What Is Redirection?
Redirection is a way for a server to tell the browser:
“The resource you’re looking for is somewhere else.”

This is done using HTTP response status codes, mainly in the 3xx range.

 Code  Meaning                    Type       Browser Behavior                     SEO Impact                   
 301   Moved Permanently          Permanent  Update bookmarks & cache it          SEO juice is passed  
 302   Found / Moved Temporarily  Temporary  Do not cache or update 
                                             bookmark                             SEO juice not passed 




🔁 Real-Time Flow: How Redirection Works
Let’s say a user visits:
                      https://example.com/old-page
The server might respond like this:
                              HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
                              Location: https://example.com/new-page
🔂 Browser Behavior:
                    Receives 301/302 from server
                    Reads the Location header
                    Issues a new request to the new URL
                    Shows the final page to the user


                        📘 301: Moved Permanently
"This page has moved forever."
Tells the browser and search engines:
“Don’t come back here. Go to the new place from now on.”

💡 Example:
            GET /old-page HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.com
            HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
            Location: /new-page
Browser:
        Caches the redirection
        Future visits to /old-page will auto-go to /new-page
        Updates bookmarks
        Search engines update their index


                      📘 302: Found (Moved Temporarily)
"This page is here for now, but might move back."
Tells the browser:
“Redirect for now, but keep the original URL bookmarked.”

💡 Example:
          GET /temporary-offer HTTP/1.1
          Host: example.com
          
          HTTP/1.1 302 Found
          Location: /offer-page
Browser:
        Does not cache the redirection
        On next visit, will request /temporary-offer again
        Search engines do not transfer ranking or SEO juice





                User ➝ https://example.com/old-page
                            ↓
                      Server (301):
                      "Go to /new-page"
                            ↓
                User ➝ https://example.com/new-page
                            ↓
                       Server responds with content


🧠 Browser Internals on Redirection
              When a browser sees 301:
              Updates its cache and history
              Bookmarks might be updated
              It remembers the redirect, so subsequent requests 
              won’t hit the original URL

When it sees 302:
            It temporarily follows the new URL
            It won’t cache or remember the redirect
            Bookmarks stay the same



 Code  Google Bot Reaction         
 301   Transfers full SEO power    
 302   Does not transfer power 
Use 301 if you're permanently moving content.
Use 302 for temporary maintenance, A/B testing, etc.



  CODE IN THE GOLANG

r := gin.Default()

// 301 redirect
r.GET("/old", func(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, "/new")
})

// 302 redirect
r.GET("/temp", func(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Redirect(http.StatusFound, "/offer")
})
