Secure Extension of HTTP

- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of the 
  standard HTTP protocol that adds a layer of security. 
- It uses bidirectional encryption to secure the communication between a 
  "client" and a "server". 
- This means that all data exchanged between the "client" and the "server"
  is encrypted, making it much harder for third parties to intercept 
  and read the data.

HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) 
digital certificates on the server side to establish secure connections.

When a client (usually a web browser) connects to an HTTPS server, 
the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to prove its identity. 

The client then verifies this certificate before establishing an encrypted 
connection.




                    Role of Certificate Authorities
SSL/TLS certificates are issued by trusted third parties known as 
Certificate Authorities (CAs). The role of a CA is to verify the 
identity of the entity requesting the certificate (usually the owner 
of a website or web application) and to sign the certificate with the 
CA's own private key.

When a client receives an SSL/TLS certificate from a server, it can 
verify the signature using the CA's public key. If the signature is 
valid and the certificate has not expired, the client can be confident
that it is communicating with the genuine server and not an imposter.

This process of verifying certificates is known as the SSL/TLS handshake.
It happens automatically in the background when you connect to a 
website using HTTPS. The presence of a valid certificate and a 
successful handshake ensures the authenticity, integrity, and 
confidentiality of the data being exchanged between the client and 
the server.

CAs play an important role in the trust model of HTTPS. 
They are responsible for thoroughly vetting the entities they 
issue certificates to and for maintaining the security and integrity 
of their own signing keys. Web browsers and operating systems maintain
a list of trusted CAs, and they will only establish trusted connections
to servers with certificates issued by these CAs.
