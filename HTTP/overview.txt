âœ… What is HTTP?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication between clients (like browsers) and servers (like web servers).

It defines how requests and responses are sent and received.

It is stateless, textbased, and follows a requestresponse model.

Example: When you visit a website (https://www.example.com), your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server sends back an HTTP response.




âœ… Where is HTTP located in the OSI Model?
HTTP operates at the Application Layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
 OSI Layer        Description               Protocols   
      
 7. Application   User interaction(HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, etc.)ðŸ”¶ HTTP 
 6. Presentation  Data formatting (SSL/TLS, encryption)              
 5. Session       Session management                                 
 4. Transport     Reliable delivery (TCP) ðŸ”· TCP      
 3. Network       Routing (IP)ðŸ”· IP       
 2. Data Link     Frame transmission

So, HTTP runs on top of TCP, which handles reliable delivery.
