HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods define the type of action a 
client (like a web browser or mobile app) wants to perform on a resource 
located on a server. 

These methods are essential for client-server communication in the context
of RESTful web services, APIs, and general web browsing.

🔹 1. GET
          Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.
          Idempotent: ✅ (Calling it multiple times has the same effect)
          Use Case: Fetching a webpage, retrieving user data.
          Example:
          GET /users/123 → Fetch data for user with ID 123.

🔹 2. POST
          Purpose: Submit data to the server to create a new resource.
          Idempotent: ❌
          Use Case: Creating a new user, submitting a form.
          Example:
          POST /users with a body containing user details → Creates a 
          new user.

🔹 3. PUT
          Purpose: Update or replace an existing resource entirely.
          Idempotent: ✅
          Use Case: Updating a user profile.
          Example:
          PUT /users/123 with a full new representation → Replaces 
          user 123’s data.

🔹 4. PATCH
            Purpose: Partially update an existing resource.
            Idempotent: ✅ (Ideally)
            Use Case: Updating a user’s email without affecting other 
            fields.

            Example:
            PATCH /users/123 with a body { "email": "new@example.com" }.

🔹 5. DELETE
            Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.
            Idempotent: ✅
            Use Case: Deleting a user account.
            Example:
            DELETE /users/123 → Deletes user with ID 123.

🔹 6. HEAD
          Purpose: Same as GET but only retrieves headers (no body).
          Use Case: Check if a resource exists or is modified.
          Example:
          HEAD /users/123 → Check if user 123 exists.

🔹 7. OPTIONS
              Purpose: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
              Use Case: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) preflight checks.
              Example:
              OPTIONS /users → Returns allowed methods like GET, POST.
