ðŸ”’ HTTPS â€” how it works, what TLS handshake is, how certificates function,
           and how encryption ensures secure communication.


HTTPS = HTTP + TLS/SSL

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. 
It encrypts data between the client (browser) and server using TLS 
(Transport Layer Security).

ðŸ§± Why Is HTTPS Needed?
ðŸ“¦ HTTP is plaintext:
Anyone (e.g., a hacker, ISP, proxy) can read or modify your data in 
transit.
Passwords, credit cards, session cookies â€” completely exposed in HTTP.

âœ… HTTPS solves this:
Encrypts data (using TLS)
Verifies identity (using certificates)
Prevents tampering (data integrity)

CORE CONCEPTS OF HTTPS 
 Component                  Role                                               
 TLS                    Encryption layer that secures HTTP                 
 Handshake              Setup process where encryption keys are agreed     
 Certificate            Verifies server identity via a trusted third party 
 Symmetric Encryption   Fast encryption used after the handshake           
 Asymmetric Encryption  Slow but secure method used during handshake       


ðŸ“¡ HTTPS Communication Flow
1. Client (Browser) connects to https://example.com
2. TLS Handshake happens
3. Secure symmetric key is shared
4. Encrypted HTTP traffic begins
