REST API
REST API stands for "Representational State Transfer - Application Programming Interface". 

It is a way for two computer systems (usually client and server) to communicate over the "HTTP protocol"
in a stateless and standardized way.

ðŸ§  Core Concept:
A REST API allows clients to access, create, update, or delete resources using HTTP methods like:
                                 HTTP Method  Action          Example                
                                 GET        Read data       Get user details       
                                 POST       Create data     Create a new user      
                                 PUT        Update data     Update entire user     
                                 PATCH      Partial update  Change user email only 
                                 DELETE     Delete data     Remove a user     



ðŸ§© Real-Time Example:
Letâ€™s say you have a Bookstore application:
URL: https://bookstore.com/api/books 
                                 Action          HTTP Method  API Endpoint     
                                 List all books  GET        /api/books     
                                 Get one book    GET        /api/books/101 
                                 Add a new book  POST       /api/books     
                                 Update a book   PUT        /api/books/101 
                                 Delete a book   DELETE     /api/books/101 


ðŸ”§ Key Features of REST APIs:
Stateless: Server doesnâ€™t store client info between requests.
Resource-based: Everything (user, book, product) is treated as a resource with a unique URI.
HTTP Methods used properly (GET, POST, etc.).
JSON or XML is commonly used to exchange data.
Client-Server separation: Frontend (client) and backend (server) are independent.
Cacheable: Responses can be cached to improve performance.
