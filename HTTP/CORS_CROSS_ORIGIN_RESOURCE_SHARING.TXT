üìå What is CORS?
                  CORS is a security feature in web browsers that controls how web 
                  pages from one origin can request data from another origin.

üìç Origin = combination of protocol + domain + port

üõë Problem it solves:
A web page 
(e.g. from https://siteA.com) tries to fetch data from a different domain 
(e.g. https://api.siteB.com). By default, this is blocked by the browser for security.
