🔰 Prerequisites Before Learning JWT in Go

1. HTTP basics (methods, headers, status codes)
2. REST API knowledge
3. Golang `net/http` or `gin` framework
4. Understanding of authentication vs. authorization
5. Base64, JSON encoding/decoding
6. Basic cryptography (HMAC, RSA, etc.)



 🧩 Core JWT Concepts (Theory)

1. What is JWT?
2. JWT vs Sessionbased authentication
3. Structure of a JWT: Header, Payload, Signature
4. Types of JWT:

   * Access Tokens
   * Refresh Tokens
5. JWT encoding: Base64Url
6. Algorithms used:

   * HS256 (HMAC + SHA256)
   * RS256 (RSA + SHA256)
7. JWT Claims:

   * Registered claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, `jti`)
   * Public claims
   * Private claims



 ⚙️ JWT in Golang  Implementation Topics

 🔐 Token Creation

1. Installing JWT library:

   * `github.com/golangjwt/jwt/v5`
   * or older: `github.com/dgrijalva/jwtgo`
2. Creating JWT token (HS256 or RS256)
3. Adding custom and registered claims
4. Setting expiration and issued time
5. Signing with a secret key or private key

 🔍 Token Validation

1. Extracting token from Authorization Header (`Bearer <token>`)
2. Parsing and validating token
3. Verifying signature and claims (e.g. `exp`, `iat`, `iss`)
4. Handling invalid/expired/malformed tokens



 🌐 Integration with Go Web Frameworks

 ✅ Gin Framework

1. Creating JWT middleware in Gin
2. Protecting routes with middleware
3. Passing user data from token to request context
4. Custom error handling in middleware

 ✅ net/http Standard Library

1. Writing middleware manually
2. Adding JWT to handlers without thirdparty framework



 🔁 JWT with Refresh Token Flow

1. Why use refresh tokens?
2. Storing refresh tokens securely
3. Issuing new access tokens via refresh
4. Handling token rotation
5. Blacklisting old tokens



 🔐 JWT and Security

1. Avoiding token tampering (verifying signature)
2. Using HTTPS for transmission
3. Token expiration best practices
4. Token revocation methods:

   * Blacklist in DB
   * Shortlived access tokens + refresh strategy
5. Securing the secret key / private key
6. Preventing token theft (e.g. from localStorage)
7. CSRF & XSS mitigation in JWT usage



 🧪 Testing and Debugging

1. Using Postman to test JWTbased auth
2. Decoding JWT at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
3. Writing unit tests for token generation/validation
4. Logging for failed auth/debugging



 🧠 Advanced Topics

1. JWT in microservices (shared secret vs. public/private key)
2. Stateless authentication using JWT
3. JWT with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
4. Multitenant JWT design
5. JWT in WebSockets
6. Storing JWT in Cookies vs. Local Storage
7. Using JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) with RS256
8. Middleware chaining and context propagation in Go



 📦 Popular Go JWT Libraries

* `github.com/golangjwt/jwt/v5` ✅ (actively maintained fork)
* `github.com/dgrijalva/jwtgo` ❌ (no longer maintained)
* `github.com/auth0/gojwtmiddleware` (used with Auth0)
* `github.com/appleboy/ginjwt` (JWT for Gin)



 🧰 Sample Realtime Projects

1. JWT login/register with Gin
2. JWT with MongoDB/MySQL for user roles
3. JWT with access/refresh token strategy
4. JWT + RBAC (RoleBased Access Control)
5. JWT auth microservice in Go



If you'd like, I can help you implement each topic stepbystep, starting from a simple token generator, then middleware, and finally complete secure JWT authentication flows in Go.

Would you like to start with basic token generation and verification in Go (Gin or net/http)?
