Definition:
            Authorization is the process of determining what resources a 
            user has access to after they’ve been authenticated.

Purpose:
        To control permissions and access levels for different users.

Real-life Analogy:
              Once you unlock the building (authentication), authorization determines which rooms you’re allowed
              to enter (e.g., employees vs. admin).

In Programming:
                After a user logs in, check if they can access:
                                                                /admin/dashboard
                                                                GET /api/data
                                                                perform DELETE on a resource
Examples:
          Role-based access control (RBAC)
          Access Control Lists (ACLs)
          Permissions like isAdmin, canEdit, canDelete
