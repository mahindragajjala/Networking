To understand and write middleware in Go, you should know:

✅ Basic Go Syntax	- To write any Go program
✅ Functions and Closures - Middleware often uses functions returning other functions
✅ Interfaces	- Middleware deals with http.Handler / gin.HandlerFunc
✅ Go HTTP Server (net/http)	- Middleware wraps the HTTP request/response flow
✅ Request & Response objects	- To manipulate headers, body, etc.
✅ Context (context.Context) -	For request-scoped values and cancellation

Once these are clear, you're ready for middleware.
