The Application Layer provides network services directly to user 
applications. 
It's the interface between userlevel software (like browsers, email 
clients) and the transport/network stack.

It corresponds to the Application + Presentation + Session Layers (Layers 5–7) 
in the OSI model.

PURPOSE:
Enable userlevel programs to send and receive meaningful data over 
the network using standard protocols.

INPUT :

➡ Data from the user or application (e.g., a typed message, a file, 
   a webpage request)




OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS IN THE APPLICATION LAYER

 Operation                          Description                                                                              
 1. Protocol Execution          Runs standard protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.                                  
 2. User Interface Integration  Interfaces with user apps like web browsers, mail clients, or CLI tools.                 
 3. Data Formatting & Encoding  (Optional) Convert data into the correct format for transfer (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML).    
 4. Session Management          Manages conversations between applications (e.g., multiple HTTP requests).               
 5. Error Reporting             If something fails (e.g., server not found), this layer can handle it or alert the user. 




PROTOCOLS: 

 Protocol            Purpose                     
 HTTP/HTTPS      Web browsing                
 FTP/SFTP        File transfers              
 SMTP/POP3/IMAP  Email sending and receiving 
 DNS             Domain name resolution      
 DHCP            IP address assignment       
 SNMP            Network monitoring          
 SSH             Secure shell access         
 Telnet          Remote login (insecure)     
 NTP             Time synchronization        


OUTPUT:
➡ Transport Layer segment (like TCP with HTTP payload)
This segment is passed to the Transport Layer, which takes care of delivery.
