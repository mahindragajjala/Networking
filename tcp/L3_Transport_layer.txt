The Transport Layer in the TCP/IP model, which plays a crucial role 
in managing endtoend communication between applications.

The Transport Layer is responsible for delivering data from one 
application process to another across a network. 

It ensures reliable or besteffort data delivery, depending on the 
protocol used.

This layer corresponds to Layer 4 (Transport Layer) in the OSI model.

                            ðŸ“¦ Data Unit: Segment
The Transport Layer receives application data, and sends it as 
segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP).

                        ðŸ”§ Main Responsibilities / Operations
 Operation                                Description                                                                                
 1. ProcesstoProcess Communication    Delivers data between application processes using port numbers.                        
 2. Connection Management             Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections (for TCP).                              
 3. Reliability                       Ensures ordered, lossless delivery (TCP only).                                         
 4. Flow Control                      Prevents sender from overwhelming the receiver (TCP only).                                 
 5. Error Detection & Recovery        Uses checksums and retransmissions to ensure data integrity (TCP only).                    
 6. Multiplexing/Demultiplexing       Allows multiple applications to send/receive data over one network connection (via ports). 


INPUT :
âž¡ Application data (e.g., HTTP request, DNS query)

Process :

 Step                            Description                                                                         
    
 1. Port Assignment          Assigns a source and destination port to identify applications.                 
 2. Segmentation             Breaks application data into manageable pieces (segments).                          
 3. Header Creation          Adds TCP/UDP header with ports, checksum, sequence numbers, etc.                
 4. Reliability Check (TCP)  Implements retransmission, acknowledgment (ACK), sequencing, etc.                   
 5. Send to Internet Layer   Encapsulates the data into a segment and sends it to the Internet Layer as payload. 

                          KEY PROTOCOLS IN THE TRANSPORT LAYER
 Protocol                                         Description                                                        
 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)          Reliable, connectionoriented. Used for web, email, file transfer. 
 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)                 Unreliable, connectionless. Used for streaming, DNS, VoIP, gaming. 
 SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)  Hybrid of TCP and UDP (used in telecom signaling).
