                    Link/Network Access Layer
The Link Layer (also called Network Access Layer or Network Interface Layer) is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model. 

It corresponds roughly to the combination of the Data Link Layer and Physical Layer in the OSI model.

                DATA LINK LAYER + PHYSICAL LAYER 

              üîπ Overview of the Link/Network Access Layer

It handles how data is physically transmitted over the network.

Responsible for connecting the device to the local network (LAN or WAN).

Deals with MAC addressing, framing, error detection, and hardwarespecific communication.

         üîπ  MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES / OPERATION OF THE LINK LAYER
 Operation                            Description                  
 1. Framing                       Divides data from the Network Layer into manageable frames for transmission.             
 2. MAC Addressing                Adds source and destination MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.                        
 3. Physical Addressing           Maps IP addresses to physical addresses (via ARP).                                       
 4. Access Control                Decides when and how a device can access the network medium (e.g., CSMA/CD in Ethernet). 
 5. Error Detection and Handling  Detects errors in frames (using CRC, checksum).                                          
 6. Encapsulation/Decapsulation   Adds and removes headers and trailers to/from the data.                                  
 7. Media Handling                Interfaces with network media like cables, wireless signals, etc.

            üß¨ How Data Looks Like at the Link Layer
Data at this layer is called a frame. 
A typical Ethernet Frame looks like this:

 Preamble  Destination MAC  Source MAC  Type  Payload  CRC 

Preamble: Sync bits for receiver
MAC addresses: Hardware addresses of source and destination
Type/Length: Indicates protocol (like IPv4, ARP)
Payload: Actual data (typically IP packet)
CRC: Error checking field (Cyclic Redundancy Check)

When sending data:

When receiving data:
Physical (raw bits) ‚Üí Data Link (frame extraction) ‚Üí Network (IP) ‚Üí Transport (TCP) ‚Üí Application

 Operation                              Details                                                          
 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)  Maps IP address to MAC address.                                  
 Link Control Protocol (LCP)        Part of PPP to establish and configure link.

 Flow Control                       Ensures sender doesn‚Äôt overwhelm receiver (e.g., stopandwait). 
 Duplexing                          Controls direction of data transfer: half/full duplex.           









                        INPUTS : ‚û° An IP packet (from the Internet Layer)
This IP packet contains:
                        IP Header (source & destination IP addresses)
                        Transport data (TCP/UDP segment)
                        Application data (payload)

PROCESS :- The Link/Network Access Layer encapsulates the IP packet into a frame and prepares it 
           for transmission through the physical medium.
üîÑ Detailed Process / Steps
 Step                                   Description                                                                                    
    
 1. Framing                         The IP packet is wrapped inside a frame by adding headers/trailers (e.g., Ethernet Frame). 
 2. MAC Address Resolution          The destination MAC address is determined (using ARP if needed).                           
 3. Encapsulation                   Adds Source MAC, Destination MAC, Type/Length, and other control fields.           
 4. Error Detection Code            A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is computed and added to detect transmission errors.       
 5. Medium Access Control (MAC)     Determines when the device can access the shared medium (e.g., using CSMA/CD).             
 6. Transmission to Physical Layer  The final frame is passed bitbybit to the physical layer for transmission.               

Inter-layer Operation
Above Layer (Internet Layer): Sends down an IP packet.
Below Layer (Physical Layer): Transmits the binary data (bits) generated from the frame.
                                
                                OUTPUT :- FRAME
This frame includes:
                    MAC Header (Destination MAC, Source MAC)
                    IP Packet (unchanged)
                    Trailer (CRC)
                    The frame is converted to electrical/optical/wireless signals and 
                    transmitted bit-by-bit via the Physical Layer.


üîÅ At Receiver Side ‚Äì What Happens?
                      Frame Reception from physical medium.
                      Error Check using CRC
                      Frame Decapsulation: MAC header/trailer removed.
                      MAC Address Check: If the destination MAC matches, process continues.
                      IP Packet Extraction: Frame payload (IP packet) is passed up to Internet Layer.
