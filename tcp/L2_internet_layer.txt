The Internet Layer is responsible for delivering data packets across 
different networks.
It determines how data travels from the source host to the destination 
host, potentially across multiple networks or routers.

It roughly corresponds to Layer 3 (Network Layer) in the OSI model.
                  üîß Main Responsibilities / Operations
 Operation                          Description                                                                                     
 1. Logical Addressing          Assigns and uses IP addresses (not MAC addresses) to identify devices across networks.      
 2. Packet Routing              Chooses the best path for data through multiple networks (via routers).                     
 3. Packet Encapsulation        Takes segments from Transport Layer and wraps them into IP packets.                         
 4. Fragmentation & Reassembly  Splits large packets if they‚Äôre too big for a network, and reassembles them at the destination. 
 5. Error Reporting (ICMP)      Uses ICMP to report delivery issues (e.g., ‚Äúhost unreachable‚Äù).                                 


                      üì¶ Data Unit: Packet
Data handled at this layer is called a packet (specifically, 
an IP packet).

üì¨ Input to Internet Layer
‚û° Transport Layer Segment (e.g., TCP or UDP segment)
Contains source/destination port numbers
Application data payload

 Process - Steps Performed in the Internet Layer
 Step                         Description                                                               
 1. IP Header Creation    Adds fields like source IP, destination IP, TTL, protocol (TCP/UDP), etc. 
 2. Routing Decision      Determines the next hop (or final destination) using routing tables.      
 3. Packet Fragmentation  If needed, breaks the packet into smaller fragments (based on MTU).       
 4. Encapsulation         Wraps the segment into an IP packet.                                      
 5. Send to Link Layer    Passes the packet to the Link Layer for framing and transmission.         

Protocols in the Internet Layer
 Protocol                                          Purpose                                                                                             
 IPv4 / IPv6                                   Main protocol for addressing and routing.                                                        
 ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)      Used for diagnostics and error reporting (e.g., ping, traceroute).                               
 IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)     Used for multicast group communication.                                                          
 ARP (used between Internet and Link Layer)    Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses (not part of pure Internet Layer, but interacts with it).
