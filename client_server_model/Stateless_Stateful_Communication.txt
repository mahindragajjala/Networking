This concept refers to how the server handles client requests 
— whether it "remembers" previous interactions or not.

                      

                      ✅ Stateless Communication
Definition: Each request is treated as independent, and the server 
does not retain any memory of previous requests from the same client.

Example: HTTP protocol (by default)

If you refresh a web page, the server doesn’t remember what you did 
before.

Pros:
    Scalable
    Easy to implement
    Low memory usage
Cons:
      Repeated work for every request
      Need to resend credentials or session info

                    ✅ Stateful Communication
Definition: The server remembers the previous interactions and 
maintains session state over multiple requests.

Example: Online banking, multiplayer games, FTP

Once logged in, the server keeps your session active across pages.

Pros:
More efficient interactions
Personalized experience
Easier for multi-step operations

Cons:
Complex to manage
Requires memory and session management
Harder to scale
