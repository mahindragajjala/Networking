🧠 What is the Client/Server Model?

The Client/Server model is a communication architecture where:
        
        A client initiates a request for services.
        A server listens for and responds to the client's request.

This model can be used over local area networks (LANs) or 
wide area networks (WANs) like the Internet.



            📊 Real-Life Analogy:
Think of a restaurant:
                      Client = You (the customer)
                      Request = You place an order
                      Server = Waiter (takes the order to the kitchen)
                      Backend/Database = Kitchen (prepares the food)
                      Response = The waiter brings back your food

          🧱 Components of the Client-Server Model
 Component     Description                                                                                                  
 Client    The software/hardware that sends requests 
           (e.g., browsers, mobile apps)                                      
 Server    The machine or application that processes requests and 
           returns responses (e.g., web server, database server) 
 Network   The medium over which clients and servers communicate 
            (e.g., TCP/IP network)                                 
 Protocol  Rules for communication (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.) 

            🛠️ Features of Client-Server Model
Centralized resources: All data resides on servers.
Scalability: Servers can serve multiple clients.
Security: Centralized control allows stronger security.
Maintainability: Easier to update/maintain servers.



              TOPICS OF THE CLIENT AND SIDE 
🔹 1. Architecture Basics
                          Definition and role of client and server
                          Characteristics of client and server
                          Stateless vs Stateful communication
